# Fast Slow Pointer Real Problems

## Symlink verification

- Symbolic links allow creating shortcuts to files.  This can create cycles where shortcuts can point to each other.  A symlink verification utility allows detecting these loops.  

## Compiling object oriented program

- When programs are compiled they are often separated into multiple files.  Dependency relationships are created in order to define the order of compilation.  This can create cyclic dependencies between files.
